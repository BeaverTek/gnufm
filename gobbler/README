 This is the libre.fm audioscrobbler server, compatible with the last.fm API.

 As things stand you'll need the MDB2 pear module installed (and at least one MDB2 driver) this can be achieved by running "pear install mdb2 mdb2#sqlite".
 (For distribution we can include the latest version of MDB2 in the release packages if we want to make things even simpler for people.)
