 This is the libre.fm audioscrobbler server, compatible with the last.fm API.

 To install visit http://yourserver.com/path/to/gobbler/install.php

 As things stand you'll need the MDB2 pear module installed (and at least one MDB2 driver) this can be achieved by running "pear install mdb2 mdb2#sqlite".
 (For distribution we can include the latest version of MDB2 in the release packages if we want to make things even simpler for people.)

 To test the authentication API once the server is set up:
  1. Navigate to /2.0/?method=auth.gettoken&api_key=01234567890123456789012345678901&api_sig=01234567890123456789012345678901
     (The api_key and api_sig are only checked to be 32 characters long since Last.FM shared secrets cannot be checked)
  2. Copy the key that is returned by the auth.gettoken method
  3. Navigate to /api/auth/?api_key=01234567890123456789012345678901&token=<copied token>
     (Inserting the copied token into the noted place)
  4. Login as testuser/password (this user is hard-coded upon database setup)
  5. Close the browser when requested
  6. Navigate to /2.0/?method=auth.getsession&api_key=01234567890123456789012345678901&api_sig=01234567890123456789012345678901&token=<copied token>
     (Once again substituting the old copied token into the noted place)
  7. The 32-byte key returned between the <key> tags in this response will be used in the Submissions protocol handshake
