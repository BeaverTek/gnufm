from various music applications, these are also known
as <em>scrobbles</em>. GNUkebox is part
of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/fm/">GNU FM</a>, and developed
for <a href="http://libre.fm/">Libre.fm</a>

and <a href="http://svn.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/*checkout*/trunk/gnukebox/AUTHORS?root=librefm&content-type=text%2Fplain">contributors</a>.</p>

this page off.</p>
